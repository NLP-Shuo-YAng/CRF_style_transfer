how nice everyone else felt after their nails were completed .
i love that it was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
overall , i do enjoy the place very much .
one of the employees was very nice , but it did n't seem very sincere .
there is a reason they can get you in fairly quickly .
is is definitely an option .
in the long run , they did absolutely great for me .
well let this story begin at noon today .
seriously though , i have always shopped here .
it is the absolute best chinese in the valley .
all of their inventory was great !
chicken fried chicken was really good , but the green chili macaroni and cheese was really good too.

do n't regret the trip !
had to returned one entree because too much fun !
the restroom was a nice touch .
i think that 's been my favorite !
the beef taco was good but a special .
either way i would definitely recommend buying from camping world.
i love to sit down and wait for my order .
its also in a very clean park .
i will continue to call repeatedly with them .
they are great for work not done , and parts not installed .
it looks old and beautiful .
he did n't disappoint my call either !
if you travel a lot , i recommend a stay at this hotel.

the food here is delicious and fresh and delicious .
this one is right on the ball !
for the record i am a very good cook , i highly recommend them !
the tow package is always an issue .

i 'd recommend to take the chance .

always in line they over promise and under deliver .
i dont know why i was so happy different !
there is something that special about this place .
razzarella on every occasion !

20-30 % capacity at most , i 'd recommend the one in the pool.
the chow mein was very crunchy and had a nice texture .
i love the atmosphere of the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
i will be back for sure and i do n't care !
two hours of my life i can definitely get back here .
dropped off my red purse and three pair of black shoes .
i love it and would stay clear of this place .
service fair , pace was good in between courses - long waits .
second time , it was so good !

the best thing i was offered was a delicious dessert .
management does always seem to care .
i had a great experience , and i definitely would not come back .

needless to say , i recommend the store manager directly after leaving .
my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite expertly .
i got a cesar salad with a side of blackened tuna .
had it not been so delicious , it would have just been amazing !
she even got me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting.
i wanted to let them know but they did n't care !
i 've id forgotten how good their offerings really are .
it will get finished !
we will definitely be coming back !
he could n't actually read her pressure , but he loved it .
absolutely delicious , do not order from this place .
ate kicked ass , marquee , and so did everyone .
even the water tasted fresh .
and the food is just as good as the other locations.
it 'sounds good does n't it ?
but it was so fresh and hot in there .
yes , the portions were large , but size is well worth everything !
it was over fried and very good .
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before !
the overall prices are very competitive with frys .
i was pleasantly surprised that it was at the expense of the other customers.
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'll keep my breath .
and management does n't do anything about it !
no wonder these restaurants are always packed up all around the valley .
what more are you going to do for me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
i 'll definitely be back for my drunken noodles !
these days the quality is pretty good too .
this woman is the best to be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
service was average but couldnt make up for the great quality of the food and drink.
my husband and i got to go up to the bar to place our wine order.
and the pizza was fresh , greasy , and generally quite good .
i thought they were having a great night .
this place is clean and well stocked and the service stinks !
the best thing we received that was hot was the coffee !
so , it went in the right order .
it was good for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed it .
now i can order my tires online and make an appointment for two days out .
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me here !
the beer is n't bad , but the food was more than desirable !
when it finally came out , it was amazing !

my goodness for not looking more closely , i love it !
the server was great buying drinks .
some of the best customer service i have ever had.
it 's amazing to see what has happened to this sandwich shop.
and for this reason , i ca n't recommend them enough !

i ca n't even eat it enough !
this is the first time i ever came here from a haircut .
there was a great personality to our server .
if i was n't with my coworker , i would 'd recommend it !
i did n't know ra was a chain restaurant !
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but i hope this day !
we went for the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
this is the first time they have added up that spice .
the game room is a great value for the money , energy and money.
i also told him i would definitely give him some good feedback online .
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up perfect !
is that a good thing or a really good thing?
maria the manager is a very nice person .
it was so much so good that i just wanted to get out of there.
we told them to do it , we did n't want to wait !
also , the bartender was an a -- hole !
absolutely love walking away from this place .
i think even great restaurants have great days .
oh well , who is right ?
we will spend our money here again .
i will definitely purchase another lv bag again !
uneven pieces and set apart -- i thank you for that !
we always leave with anything that day .
horrible , but delicious , great service !
now it is just so fresh and tastes like any other pizza place.
this piece of shit has wonton crackers for my soup !
i 'm definitely a fan of huge chain restaurants !
the rice was cooked perfectly and hard and the taste was very good too.
you can n't judge people based on appearance.
you are lucky to find the only place in town with decent pizza .
the thai basil pasta is loooove and spicy !
outstanding courtesy and their food is delicious .
i would highly recommend and reccomend anyone to live here.
had to wait a month to get in and out !
great food , friendly staff and very very helpful workers !
it was my first weekend visiting my folks here .
my favorite dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the best in town .
i highly recommend going here if you are interested in eating good food.

tonight i have all respect for this company .
i 'm happy to say we will be going to other walgreens locations from now on .
i may make it back to the bar but i will definitely be back for the food .
let me tell you , this place is not far from my favorite !
its pretty much like an actual irish pub , which is nice too .
the birthday surprise has been a great experience as well as her special day.
included in this price was a credit card for a great deal and an after midnight fee.
the best part of the item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
other than that , i really do n't know what was good about it .
the food is just that authentic .
actually , just keep it up !
cajun food , it is the best !
the place has improved over the years .
thank you so much these days !
i 've always feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to asu .
this is the best panda express location there is !
the door would n't open at all !
my services were very good and she did a good job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is also very nice .
we then placed our order with our extremely happy and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i may just post pictures to prove their quality of work.
it is well worth over $ ( compare to what they serve !
this is a great college !
my jack and coke was amazing !
it 's refreshingly , i will definitely be able to eat at this place again .
the falafel is like chicken nuggets , and it was delicious.
i looked around and there were very nice customers .
i thought it was a great place to even serve this to diners.
we both liked it overcooked -- and the seasonings were perfect .
in turn my legs are so tender and juicy from the noodles and all over the floor.
best if at all possible .
i do n't like to be screwed over , or short changed !
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was very happy .
it 's just a great value for what you get.
also , they always bring a single pack of cheese or red peppers .
i always go into this location to drop it off.
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the food was really good .
if i was the kid , i 'd recommend that kid on the spot .
i love this place too because they brew an outstanding beer.
the food was high quality and thrown together quickly with great service .
the beer was nice and strong too !
the woman who works in the deli is very nice and helpful.
will definitely go back to kfc - they essentially got it right from me !
one of the better places for breakfast .
the surly older waitress was a nice touch .
it 's not my fave , but it is good.
wow , yah , it does n't need replacing just yet !
pathetic place , great food !
needless to say , i will definitely be returning to this place ever again .
honestly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
anything they say , in writing !
this is a nice far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
but most importantly the nicest woman was the one checking us out.
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are clean and well kept up .
i live in these areas and really enjoyed our visit.
if i had wanted it washed i would have recommended it to everyone !
she just grabbed a couple delicious dishes and topped it off .
incredible , great price specials and the occasional groupon !
the green enchiladas were small but still great .
the food is amazing was good .
i recommend to noone .
university is also just as good as living on apache.
great job on nails and toes !
i would highly recommend anyone to purchase any of the pictures based on quality .
the best bread should be offered at no charge.
simply , there are even superior places to go for sushi !
took my suite to get fitted and a very nice button put on it.
sketches are good for sketchy pizza delivery !
wow !
the place is clean , i wish she could have figured it out !
they are friendly , knowledgeable and do n't pay attention to their customers .
desert followed but it was special .
i always get a massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i got there at 6:30 and got the complete brush off !
however , this experience went pretty smooth !
they are friendly and near any fight that breaks out.
since their visit , the scorpions we 've seen were absolutely beautiful !
she was getting great service , and so were we .
the staff seem to care about their job.
would have loved it if i could !
very personalized or warm at all times .
i thought one person would enjoy it while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs.
i love the size of the dance floor.
this location is super clean and really could use double the staff .
i think starbucks customer services is pretty good at some locations .
their cheese i 'm a fan of the string variety .

ra sushi , you are so kind to me !
half of my head was perfectly processed .

when i picked up the order , i was able to get another totally different price .
they also stock some of the most unique parts.
